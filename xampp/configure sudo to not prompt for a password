you can configure sudo to not prompt for a password when running specific commands. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the sudoers file with the visudo command:
```
sudo visudo
```

2. Scroll down to the bottom of the file and add the following lines:
```
# Configure sudo to not prompt for a password when running xampp command
<your_username> ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /opt/lampp/lampp start, /opt/lampp/lampp stop, /opt/lampp/lampp restart
```
Replace `<your_username>` with your actual username.

3. Save and exit the file. 

Now, when you run the commands `lamppstart`, `lamppstop`, or `lampprestart`, it won't prompt you for a password. Make sure you're aware of the security implications of granting passwordless sudo access for specific commands.
